Huarong Dao Puzzle Solver
-	Used A* Search and DFS search to find the solutions for Huarong Dao puzzle
-	A* used a simple heuristic that will find the optimal solution 

Decision Tree on Predicting Wine Quality Based on Filters
-	Used 5-fold cross validation to predict the wine quality based on different filters
-	Grew trees using stopping criteria of max-depth, min info-gain, also grew a full tree based on all data 

Bayesian Network
-	Constructed a Bayesian network of a scenario and used variable elimination algorithm to calculate the probability of a given event

Reinforcement Learning: Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP)
-	Used ADP to calculate the long-term reward and optimal policy of each state in a constructed grid world
